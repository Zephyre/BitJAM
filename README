Usage:



Embed the BitJAM java applet (BitJAM.class) in your webpage, like this:

<APPLET CODE="BitJAM" width=1 height=1></APPLET>


Then run bitjamserver.py on your server.
bitjamserver.py must be run from the same ip as the applet.
Any computer on the same local area network should work,
as long as it's receiving tcp traffic on port 15063.
So, make sure port 15063 isn't blocked by any firewalls,
and make sure that tcp traffic on port 15063 is being forwarded
to the machine bitjamserver.py is running on if you're behind NAT.


bitjamserver.py example arguments:
-u username --pass password -o host -p port
port defaults to 8332.




That's about it. It takes a while for shares to be generated, but I'm 
guessing that with enough web traffic, it should generate a decent 
amount.

For future releases, I have some ideas for speeding the app up, I think
I could probably bump the speed up somewhere between 2 to 8 times the
current level, add parameter customization to the applet, and possibly 
increase the number of users that can be handled simultaneously, among 
other things.
